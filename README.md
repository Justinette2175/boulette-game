## About

This project is a web version of a multiplayer game known in Quebec as "boulette", in which players write down words on pieces of paper which they put in a bowl, and then have teammates guess through different rounds: by describing the words, by miming, or by making sounds for example.

It is built using the Firestore real-time database and firebase cloud functions. It also uses twillio's API for real-time video conferencing. It uses the paypal API for purchasing premium games.

Boulette is still under construction.
